## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

- **Backend:**

  - Node.js >= 16.x
  - npm or yarn
  - Hyundai BlueLink account (Brazil region only)

- **Watch App:**
  - Xcode installed
  - Apple Watch (or simulator)
  - macOS for development and testing

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation

Clone the repository and install both the backend API and Watch App:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/bluelink-br-api.git
cd bluelink-br-api
npm install
```

Navigate to the `watch-app` folder and open the Xcode project:

```bash
cd watch-app/bluelink-br Watch App
open bluelink-br.xcodeproj
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration

#### Watch App Configuration

No specific configuration needed‚Äîjust make sure your Apple Watch is connected or use the simulator.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Running the App

#### Backend

Start the server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the Swagger docs at: [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)

#### Watch App Configuration

To set up the **BlueLink Watch App**, follow these steps:

1. **Xcode Setup**

   - Open the **Watch App project** in Xcode:
     ```bash
     cd watch-app/bluelink-br Watch App
     open bluelink-br.xcodeproj
     ```
   - Ensure that your Xcode project is set up with an **Apple Watch** target.

2. **Change Credentials in ContentView.swift**

   - To connect the Watch App to the **BlueLink API**, you need to update the credentials in the `ContentView.swift` file.

   - Open `ContentView.swift` in Xcode and locate the section where the credentials are defined:

     ```swift
         let userEmail = "your@mail.com"  // <-- Replace with your actual email
         let userPassword = "easy123"     // <-- Replace with your actual password
     ```

   - Replace `your@mail.com` with your **Hyundai BlueLink account email**.
   - Replace `easy123` with your **Hyundai BlueLink account password**.

   > **Note:** Ensure that you are using a **Hyundai BlueLink account** for the **Brazil region** to authenticate successfully.

3. **Warning: API pointing to localhost:3000**

   - The **Watch App** is configured to interact with the **backend API running on localhost:3000** by default. If you're running the backend locally, ensure the server is up and running on port **3000**.
   - If you need to change the backend URL (e.g., for a production environment), make sure to update the `ContentView.swift` and `LockUnlockScreen.swift` to point to the correct API endpoint.

4. **Running the Watch App on Your Device or Simulator**

   - Make sure your **Apple Watch** is connected to your development machine via **Xcode**. If you're using a simulator, select your **Apple Watch target** in Xcode and click **Run** to launch the Watch app.
   - You can now test the Watch App with the configured **user credentials**.

5. **Access the API**
   - Once the credentials are updated, the app will authenticate with the **BlueLink API** using the provided email and password.
   - The backend will generate the necessary access and control tokens for the Watch App to interact with your vehicle.

## üîë Endpoints (Backend)

### Authentication

- **POST /auth/login**  
  Input your email and password, and get back the tokens required for authentication.

### PIN Services

- **PUT /pin**  
  Validate the PIN and return the control token used to operate your vehicle.

### Vehicle Management

- **GET /vehicle**  
  Retrieve data on all registered vehicles linked to your account.

- **POST /vehicle/control-door**  
  Open or close the vehicle doors, allowing full control through the Watch app.

- **GET /vehicle/{vehicleId}/status**  
  Retrieve the current status of your vehicle, including information such as whether the door is locked or unlocked.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Backend API

The **BlueLink Brazil API** is the backend that powers the Apple Watch app. It handles all the core operations, including authentication, PIN validation, and vehicle door control. The API interacts with Hyundai's BlueLink services and makes this data available to the Watch App.

### Apple Watch App

The **Watch App** communicates directly with the backend API to perform vehicle actions. It uses the control tokens generated by the backend to ensure secure and efficient interactions with the vehicle's systems. With the app, users can:

- **Control vehicle doors**: Lock and unlock your vehicle remotely.
- **Validate PINs**: Securely authenticate and validate PINs for added security.
